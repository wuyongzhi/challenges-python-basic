## Step 1: Write Chapter Outline for chapter 1
### How to create the Chapter Outline
* Make the outline of concepts in [this template](http://bit.ly/2RYa1Rr).
  * Make a copy of the file before you start editing it.
  * Get a shareable link for your document, allowing anyone with the link to access the document.
  * Paste the link below (section _Your outline_).
* While going through the course, list all learning objectives and introduced concepts, packages and functions for each lesson – a lesson comprises of a video followed by some interactive exercises.

### Your outline
- [ ] [Link to your outline](link)

### Chapter Outline checklist
- [ ] Are the learning objectives concise, yet specific?
- [ ] Are the learning objectives testable?
- [ ] Do you cover only the learning objectives relevant to this course?
- [ ] Are all relevant concepts, functions, and packages included?


## Step 2: Write Practice Outline for Chapter 1
### How to create the Practice Outline
* Make the outline of concepts in [this template](http://bit.ly/2W8hvk0).
  * Make a copy of the file before you start editing it.
  * Get a shareable link for your document, allowing anyone with the link to access the document.
  * Paste the link below (section _Your outline_).
* For each learning objective in the Chapter Outline, specify which exercise type you will use and what the concept, package or function is that the learner needs to know.
* A typical Practice Outline comprises between 10 to 20 exercises per chapter.

### Practice Outline checklist
- [ ] Is it clear from the outline which concepts will be tested?
- [ ] Are the most important things tested?
- [ ] Is it clear what exactly is going to be tested?
- [ ] Is there a good mix of exercise types?
   We believe that our students practice best when the exercises are challenging and diverse. To that end, we encourage you to ensure a good mix of various exercise types in each chapter. Here's the mix we propose: MultipleChoiceChallenges < 25%, OutputChallenges < 35%, and BlanksChallenges ≥ 40%.

## Step 3: Create exercises for Chapter 1 in the Teach Editor
### Content vision
it is the goal of practice exercises to
* check if the student has a correct understanding of the course
* check whether the student remembers the most important things taught in the course
* allow the student to exercise until s/he can apply what s/he's learned in the course without having to look things up

### Content checklist
- [ ] Does each exercise have a name?
- [ ] Does each exercise check exactly what you want to test?
- [ ] Are all distractors distracting? Is it realistic someone might think they are the correct answer?
- [ ] Will the student spend most time answering the question, instead of understanding what is being asked?
- [ ] Do the different versions of an exercise test the same concept?
- [ ] Do all sentences start with a capital letter and end with a punctuation mark?
- [ ] Is the code formatted nicely, using newlines where necessary? Review the mobile preview in a screen with the dimensions of a smartphone (type iPhone SE) when you're in doubt.
- [ ] Does the output not contain more than 5 lines?
- [ ] Do tables contain no more than 3 columns?
- [ ] Is every BlanksChallenge suited for a typing exercise (i.e. does it contain sufficient information)?
- [ ] Is the context (for coding exercises, if used) or assignment (for multiple choice questions) concise? These should not exceed 200 characters.
- [ ] DataCamp values diversity; do you use diverse protagonists in your context (if any)? 
- [ ] Does each exercise adhere to the [Practice style guidelines](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/daily-practice/guidelines/practice-style-guidelines)?

## Step 4: Create exercises for the remaining chapters on the Teach Editor
Follow the content vision, guidelines and checklist outlined above.
