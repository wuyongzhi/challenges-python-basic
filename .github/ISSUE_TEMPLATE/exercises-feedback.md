_[don't forget to add the chapter number to the title of this issue]_

- [ ] Does Preview work for each exercise?

### Content checklist
- [ ] Do you have at least one "easter egg" exercise in this chapter? 
   Easter eggs are fun surprises in the code ([example](http://bit.ly/2I44wvR)). Exercises that contain an easter egg increase the engagement of our learners, and they're just FUN :smile:
- [ ] Does each exercise check exactly what you want to test?
- [ ] Are all distractors distracting? Is it realistic someone might think they are the correct answer?
- [ ] Will the student spend most time answering the question, instead of understanding what is being asked?
- [ ] Do the different versions of an exercise test the same concept?
- [ ] Is every BlanksChallenge suited for a typing exercise (i.e. does it contain sufficient information)?

### Style checklist
- [ ] Do all sentences start with a capital letter and end with a punctuation mark?
- [ ] Is the code formatted nicely, using newlines where necessary?
   Review the mobile preview in a screen with the dimensions of a smartphone (type iPhone SE) when you're in doubt. Each line in a BlankChallenge code block should not exceed **40 characters**.
- [ ] Does the output not contain more than 5 lines?
- [ ] Do tables contain no more than 3 columns?
- [ ] Is the context (for coding exercises, if used) or assignment (for multiple choice questions) concise? These should not exceed 200 characters.
- [ ] DataCamp values diversity; do you use diverse protagonists in your context (if any)? 
- [ ] Does each exercise adhere to the [Practice style guidelines](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/daily-practice/guidelines/practice-style-guidelines)?
