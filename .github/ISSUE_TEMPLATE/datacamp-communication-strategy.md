We want you to build high-quality content for DataCamp and we know you'll have questions. The following outlines the steps you should take when you have a question to get them answered quickly and by the right people.

## 1. Have you visited the documentation?

- No? Look for your answer [here](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/)

- Yes, but I didn't find my answer. --> Move onto step 2

## 2. Is your question a Content question or a Product question?

- Do you have a question related to the content you are creating? Move onto step 3.

- Do you think you've found a bug in our editor or have a feature to request? This is a Product question. To report a bug or a request a feature, [log into your practice pool](https://www.datacamp.com/teach/content/challenges) and start a new conversation using the Intercom widget. Intercom conversations will put you in direct content with our Product Manager and Engineering teams.

## 3. Ask your Content contact a question in a GitHub issue

GitHub is the quickest way and clearest way to get a content-related question answered. Furthermore, your GitHub repository will exist as long as your DataCamp content, so if you need to refer to an old issue; it will always be there.

When writing a new issue, make sure to tag your DataCamp point-of-contact with an @mention. Also, it's imperative that DataCamp can contact **you**. Make sure to watch your repo. If you do not visit GitHub regularly, set up e-mail notifications to ensure you do not miss any issues we send you. Successful instructors are communicative instructors, so please keep in touch with us to ensure smooth and fruitful content creation.
