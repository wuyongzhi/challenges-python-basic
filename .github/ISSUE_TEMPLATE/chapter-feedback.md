- [ ] Did you commit your outlines to a new branch and create a pull request to merge them into `development`?

### Chapter outline
- [ ] Are the learning objectives concise, yet specific?
- [ ] Are the learning objectives testable?
- [ ] Do you cover only the learning objectives relevant to this course?
- [ ] Are all relevant concepts, functions, and packages included?

### Practice outline
- [ ] Does the practice outline include all learning objectives from the chapter outline, in *the same order*?
- [ ] Is it clear from the outline which concepts will be tested?
- [ ] Are the most important things tested?
- [ ] Is it clear what exactly is going to be tested?
- [ ] Is there a good mix of exercise types?
   We believe that our students practice best when the exercises are challenging and diverse. To that end, we encourage you to ensure a good mix of various exercise types in each chapter. Here's the mix we propose: MultipleChoiceChallenges < 25%, OutputChallenges < 35%, and BlanksChallenges â‰¥ 40%.
- [ ] Are the exercises use case based? 
   Asking learners to **apply** knowledge to a real-world problem is more engaging than asking learners to differentiate correct theory from incorrect theory.
